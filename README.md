# Math-Quest

Math Quest is currently under construction, so it is rather boring here at the moment.

Math Quest is/will be a web application teaching aid to middle school and high school math teachers. The mission is to make math learning more accessible to struggling students by framing concepts with their exciting historical narratives.

The general idea is that math is much more than the stale subject that many young learners see it as, but it is in fact an evolving art and has gone through tremendous debate over the centuries.

A classic example of "wrapping" a compelling narrative would be the story of Carl Friedrich Gauss as an elementary student in the 1700s, who came up with the summing pairs technique of the summation of series after being reprimanded by his teacher for being too precocious!

The web app will support students and teacher logins on a back end and deployment through the Ruby on Rails framework. Our front-end will involve the use of html,css using bootstrap4 and js libraries for visualization of 3d graphics.
